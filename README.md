# landing-page-odin
This is the "landing page" project from The Odin Project

In this project I have to create a Landing page starting with a picture of the desired end result and a picture listing all colors and font I need.

I'm thrilled do to my first page from scratch and I'm honored it will contain a silly quote from Thor. Wich, I guess, codes smashing buttons with his hammer.

Here you can find all  the details: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page
